NAME
-----
coap-oscore-conf
- CoAP OSCORE configuration file format

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The OSCORE configuration file is read in when using the _*-E* oscore_conf_file_
option for the *coap-client*(5) or *coap-server*(5) executables. This then
allows a client or server to use OSCORE to protect the CoAP information
between endpoints (https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8613[RFC8613]).

It is also read in and parsed by *coap_new_oscore_conf*(3).

This configuration file can be a configuration held in memory, the formatting
of the memory region is same as that for a file as if the file was mapped
into memory. The *coap_new_oscore_conf*(3) function uses the memory
version of the file.

The configuration file comprises of a set of keywords, the value of the
keyword encoding type and the keyword value, one per line, comma separated.

keyword,encoding,value

The keywords are case sensitive.  If a line starts with a *#*, then it is
treated as a comment line and so is ignored. Empty lines are also valid
and ignored.

The possible encodings are:

*ascii* ::
    The value is encoded as a binary representation of the ascii string. This
    string can optionally be enclosed in _"_.

*bool* ::
    The textual string is either true or false and is subsequently encoded as
    an integer number.

*hex* ::
    The value is encoded as a binary representation of the hex string. This
    string can optionally be enclosed in _"_.

*integer* ::
    The value is encoded as an integer number.

*text* ::
    The string value is mapped and then encoded as an integer number. This
    string can optionally be enclosed in _"_. A subset of the Names from
    https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#algorithms or
    https://www.iana.org/assignments/cose/cose.xhtml#elliptic-curves are
    supported.

*pub_file_pem* ::
    The public key is read from the specified .pem file and is encoded
    internally as a binary representation of the value. This .pem file can
    optionally be enclosed in _"_.

*pri_file_pem* ::
    The private key is read from the specified .pem file and is encoded
    internally as a binary representation of the value. This .pem file can
    optionally be enclosed in _"_.

*pub_asn1* ::
    The public key (encoded as ASN1(DER)) is read from the binary
    representation of the hex string. This string can optionally be enclosed
    in _"_.

*pri_asn1* ::
    The private key (encoded as ASN1(DER)) is read from the binary
    representation of the hex string. This string can optionally be enclosed
    in _"_.

The valid keywords are:
